The HTree class holds the methods and members required to make HTree objects with a key, a value, and left and right
HTree children. Each of these members are private, accessed only with getter methods. The path_to method is also public,
and checks that a given key is within the tree (crashing if it isn't) and returning a list to it from the tree's head.
